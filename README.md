## **_Project Overview/Purpose_** <br/>

For our project, we have utilized publicly available data from the Government of Western Australia pertaining to the Western Australian school system. This data, compiled during Semester 1 of this year, encompasses a wide range of statistical information.

Our goal is to create a user-friendly interface that enables parents and prospective students to quickly and effectively access easy-to-understand information about schools of interest. We have incorporated both tabular data and graphical representations to enhance the accessibility and comprehensibility of the project's data.

## **_Instructions for Use_** <br/>

Our interactive dashboard allows for the anaylsis of geographical distribution, school sizes, and grade ranges. Users have the ability to search the data based on both postcode and school name while still providing a visually attractive interface.

1. **Searching by postcode:** Simply select the desired postcode from the dropdown list at the top of the page, and the table below will display all the schools available in that postcode. Hovering over the school name will expand the field for greater readability.<br/>

2. **Schools by Region:** The pie chart at the left of the screen shows the breakdown of number of schools by region. Hovering over the pie wedges will display the specific tallies for that region. <br/>

3. **Searching by school name:** Simply select the desired school name from the dropdown list at the right of the page, and the bar chart below will show the number of students by year in the selected school. The summary window below will also display the selected school's characteristics.

4. **Map View:** The map view at the bottom of the screen shows the geographical locations for all schools in the database. Zoom in and out by using the "+" or "-" buttons, or by using your mouse wheel. The nodes show the count of schools by location, and expand/retract in response to the level of zoom. At the highest zoom, markers are clickable objects that display school-specific information.<br/>

## **_Dataset Availability_** <br/>

The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed here:<br/>

## **_Ethical Considerations_** <br/>

In developing this project, we prioritized ethical considerations to ensure the responsible use and presentation of data. The publicly available information source provided by the Government of Western Australia ensured maximum transparency and legality. We considered anonymizing any personally identifiable information if present to protect privacy. Additionally, we focused on accurate representation and avoided any incomplete data or manipulative visualizations that could mislead users. Our goal is to provide an informative tool that respects data integrity and user trust.
