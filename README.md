## **_Dataset Description_** <br/>

We chose to use data from the Government of Western Australia regarding the Western Australia school system. This source was selected because it offers a wide range of statistical categories and the data is current. The student numbers are based on the latest census conducted in Semester 1, 2024.

Our interactive dashboard allows for the anaylsis of geographical distribution, school sizes, and grade ranges. Users have the ability to search the data based on both postcode and school name while still providing a visually attractive interface.
